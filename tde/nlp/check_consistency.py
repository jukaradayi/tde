# Check the consistency of the class file you're about to evaluate.
# First, check if the format is good (in particular, check if the line
# of the file is a blank line).
# Then, check that none of the intervals found in the class file contains
# silence. To do that, we build an interval tree with the intervals of
# silences, using the vad, and check for each interval found by the
# algorithm that none overlap with the silence. Overlap of a very small
# number of frames (2 ?) is permissible.
# Some solutions are suggested to treat the non conform pairs.
#
# Input
# - Class File : file containing the found pairs, in the ZR challenge format:
#
#       Class1
#       file1 on1 off1
#       file2 on2 off2
#
#       Class2
#       [...]
#
# - VAD : VAD corresponding to the corpus on which you
#
# Output
# - List of all the intervals that overlap with Silence (outputs nothing if
#   all the intervals are okay)
